      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>StarCraft (1998) is a real-time strategy (RTS) game developed by Blizzard Entertainment. It introduced players to an expansive sci-fi universe set in the Koprulu Sector, where three distinct factions—Terrans, Zerg, and Protoss—fight for dominance. Each faction has unique units and abilities, creating varied strategies and playstyles.</p>
      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <li>
        Terrans: Human exiles from Earth, known for their adaptability and powerful defensive structures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Zerg: Insect-like creatures that focus on overwhelming enemies with massive numbers and biological mutations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protoss: An advanced and highly intelligent race with powerful, high-tech units and shields, but lower unit numbers.
      </li>
      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p>
        The game's story follows a series of conflicts:
      <li>
        Terrans: Led by characters like Jim Raynor, a rebel, and Arcturus Mengsk, a power-hungry leader, the Terrans are caught in a war against both the Zerg and the Protoss.
      </li>
      <li>
        Zerg: Led by the ruthless and intelligent Overmind, the Zerg aim to assimilate the galaxy by consuming all other species. Their main antagonist is the Terran forces, and later, the Protoss.
      </li>
      <li>
        Protoss: The noble, yet highly isolationist race, initially seeks to stop the Zerg invasion. The Protoss struggle with internal division, especially due to the actions of the Zerg's Queen, Kerrigan.
      </li>
      <li>
        The game’s narrative is told through the perspectives of each faction in a series of missions that unfold the complex relationships, betrayals, and strategic decisions in the galaxy.

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>StarCraft set the standard for competitive RTS games, especially with its multiplayer features. It became a global phenomenon, with a strong esports scene, particularly in South Korea. Its legacy continues through its sequels and its influence on future RTS games.</p>
