      <h3>Summary About RTS Games</h3>
      <p>
        Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games are a subgenre of strategy games where players control units and structures in real-time, as opposed to turn-based games where players take turns. The objective in RTS games is typically to gather resources, build bases, create armies, and defeat opponents.
      </p>
      <h3>Key Features to RTS Games</h3>
      <li>
        Real-Time Gameplay: Actions occur continuously, with no pauses between moves. Players must think and act quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Resource Management: Players collect resources (like wood, gold, or energy) to build structures, upgrade units, and maintain their economy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Base Building: Players construct various buildings that allow for different types of unit production and technological advancements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unit Control: Players direct individual or groups of units (soldiers, vehicles, etc.) to attack, defend, or complete tasks. The effectiveness of units is often determined by their type and position.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strategic Decision Making: Successful RTS gameplay requires a combination of tactical micromanagement (controlling units precisely) and strategic planning (deciding what resources to focus on, which units to build, etc.).
      </li>

      <h3>My Favorite RTS Games</h3>
      <p>
        There are many RTS games, and the ones listed above are just a few that stand out in 2025. Some others that still stand out are StarCraft, StarCraft 2, Northgard, the entire Age of Empires series, the entire Total War Series, and the first three games of the Warcraft series. In fact, on Steam, four of the Total War series are currently the top 16 RTS games in terms of players, and three of the Age of Empires series also make that same list. Due to personal expertise and my fondness for these games, I will talk about the StarCraft series, Northgard, the Age of Empires series, the Total War series, and the Warcraft series, which I have put in order from my favorite to my least favorite out of my top five favorite RTS series/games.

      <h3>What Makes a Great RTS Game?</h3>
      <p>
        The best RTS games share several common elements that make them engaging and replayable. Balance is crucial—each faction or civilization must have strengths and weaknesses that create interesting strategic choices. Depth matters too, with layers of strategy from resource management to unit composition to tactical positioning. The best games also have strong competitive scenes, allowing players to test their skills against others and constantly improve. Finally, great RTS games have distinct identities: StarCraft's asymmetric factions, Age of Empires' historical accuracy, or Northgard's survival mechanics make each game unique and memorable.
      </p>
      <h3>Getting Started with RTS Games</h3>
      <p>
        For newcomers to the RTS genre, starting can be overwhelming. Here are some tips:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with single-player campaigns to learn game mechanics at your own pace.</li>
        <li>Focus on one faction or civilization initially to understand its strengths and strategies.</li>
        <li>Practice resource management and economy before worrying about complex tactics.</li>
        <li>Watch professional players or streamers to learn advanced strategies.</li>
        <li>Don't be discouraged by losses—improvement comes with practice and experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Age of Empires II is often recommended for beginners due to its excellent tutorial and balanced gameplay, while StarCraft II offers a more challenging but rewarding experience for those ready for competitive play.
